These principles, taken together, describe the most effective, ethical, and modern approach to data teamwork.

* Use data to improve life for our users, customers, organizations, and communities.
* Create reproducible and extensible work.
* Build teams with diverse ideas, backgrounds, and strengths.
* Prioritize the continuous collection and availability of discussions and metadata.
* Clearly identify the questions and objectives that drive each project and use to guide both planning and refinement.
* Be open to changing our methods and conclusions in response to new knowledge.
* Recognize and mitigate bias in ourselves and in the data we use.
* Present our work in ways that empower others to make better-informed decisions.
* Consider carefully the ethical implications of choices we make when using data, and the impacts of our work on individuals and society.
* Respect and invite fair criticism while promoting the identification and open discussion of errors, risks, and unintended consequences of our work.
* Protect the privacy and security of individuals represented in our data.
* Help others to understand the most useful and appropriate applications of data to solve real-world problems.
