Your customers move from one online property (FB) to your website after seeing your FB ads. However, they are not ready to transact. (i.e. waiting for payday). You want to keep your value proposition continuously in the minds of your customers

How do you go about setting up tracking to

- allow for effective A/B testing of ads
- track website drop offs
- enabling re-targeting

Keeping in mind, the following activities of your targeted customers

- specific products or services viewed as well as purchase history.
- Visit a website where display advertising is available.
- Perform a keyword search on a search engine
- Watch a YouTube video.
- Use a social media site

Usually, it involves adding codes to specific page-views or actions which can be intimidating if you are not familiar with modifying codes, keeping these modify codes in one place and IT support is not forthcoming.

Taking into account of the following fact

- Cookies are aligned with browsers and not people, a visitor using different browsers will be registered as different visitor. In other words, a visitor navigating a site on Safari on their iPhone would register as a different visitor when using Chrome on their personal computer.
- Safari's Intelligent Tracking Prevention (ITP) 2.1, launch in March 2019 will cap the GA cookie at 7 days instead of 2 years.
- When your Google Ads data might not match your imported Google Analytics data. 

You also want marketing data from various sources to be in one place accessible without learning a programming language
