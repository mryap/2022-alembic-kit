Google notes that “[53% of users will abandon a site if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load](https://developers.google.com/web/progressive-web-apps/).” A few years ago, Amazon published a fascinating statistic that they [lost 1% of sales for every 100ms of latency](https://www.digitalrealty.com/blog/the-cost-of-latency/).

Wondering which of your website pages are effecting your load times? 

Starting in July 2018, page speed will be a ranking factor for mobile searches. Here are some resources that can be used to evaluate a website page’s performance.

- [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report/), a public dataset of key user experience metrics for popular destinations on the web, as experienced by Chrome users under real-world conditions
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), an automated tool and a part of Chrome Developer Tools for auditing the quality (performance, accessibility, and more) of web pages

- [PageSpeed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), a tool that indicates how well a page performs on the Chrome UX Report and suggests performance optimizations

Popular search engines like Google prioritize sites served over HTTPS.  Google has announced a deadline of July 2018 as the date for when Chrome will begin explicitly warning users if a site is insecure. [[Link](https://security.googleblog.com/2018/02/a-secure-web-is-here-to-stay.html)]

Most web hosting providers already provide free HTTPS certificates as well as low cost certificates. Netlify provides this functionality for free, even for custom domains, with their 1-Click SSL through Let’s Encrypt. **It time to upgrade your website to HTTPS**
