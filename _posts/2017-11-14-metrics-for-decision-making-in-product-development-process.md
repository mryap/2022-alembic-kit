Google's HEART framework for user-centered metrics measure different parts of the product life cycle.

The framework reflects

* The quality of user experience (the HEART framework: Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task success)
* The goals of your product or project (the Goals-Signals-Metrics process)

If you want your product’s design to be informed by large-scale data, it helps to have metrics that reflect the quality of the user experience that map closely to your main goals.

It seeks to measure the user experience of your product.
