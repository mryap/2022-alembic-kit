Measuring non-profit and government websites is a bit more challenging. You need to figure out your goals and measure how efficient you are in achieving them. Every organization needs money to operate. In a non-commerce environment, the objective won’t be profit, but rather achieving more with less.

For non-profit, here are just some ways to incorporate non-commerce goals into the financial statement:

-  The cost of attracting volunteers and optimizing to bring that number down

-  The cost of attracting donations (how much do you spend for every dollar collected) and optimizing to bring that number down

-  For government and advocacy sites – cost per visitor (you want to spread your message further for less) and cost per engagement.
