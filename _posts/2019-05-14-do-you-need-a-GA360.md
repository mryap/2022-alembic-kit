Google Analytics is the most important tool for improving your website and digital marketing. Most Google Analytics setups are not customised at all.

It should be customised based on your company business models, strategy, web site and marketing channels.  Otherwise, you are just tracking things Google's engineers thought you should be tracking. (by default)

Here what can be customised

✅ Use custom dimensions for recording qualitative information about hits, users and sessions.

✅ Use custom metrics in addition to standard metrics.

✅ Use content groups based on content topic, category, author or web page template.

✅ Track UI elements like buttons, links and videos with events.

✅ Use monetary goal values instead of just tracking thank you pages.

✅ Create your own channels for campaign tracking.

✅ Import advertising cost data from Facebook and other advertising channels.

### Page View

While the data collected from pageviews alone is useful, it doesn’t tell the whole story. To get a better picture of how users are experiencing your site or application, you have to send additional interaction data to Google Analytics.

### UTM
By default  Google Analytics(GA) only provide `source` & `medium` information of the referral traffic. If you want GA to provide more information about your marketing campaigns that you need to add campaign tracking variables at the end of each destination URLs of your ads. Not using tracking parameters is a mistake that many marketers who are just starting out make. Avoid "dark traffic" and get richer campaign data by using UTM parameters in URLs for your digital marketing campaigns
 
All of this is available for free Universal Analytics. You don't need a GA360  - just a marekting analytics developer like me to implement the features.
