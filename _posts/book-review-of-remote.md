<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Working remotely is not buying Zoom and filling your time with video conferences. Proper remote working requires a shift in mindset, a dissolution of fear of the unknown, and putting trust in your people.

Picked up a copy of Remote at a local library. Authored by Founders of 37Signals, they lay out the argument for working remotely and not bound by a geographical location.

Draw on their experience of managing remote workforce in New Zealand and Denmark from Chicago as well as other progressive company, the book shows how you can reap the benefits of having a remote work force and mitigate the drawbacks.

If you think this is a good excuse to outsource jobs to some Asia countries, it wrong. The authors argued going remote promotes quality of life and getting access to people who might not want to fly half-way across the globe to work with you.

They list the likes of IBM, Dreamworks Animation, Virgin Airline, Deloitte (accounting) who are ready going remote and the saving they benefits from such work arrangement.

My favourite part of the book is where they layout the excuses and how to deal with those excuses with clarity. I list out some in table form.

To quote Richard Benson

> To successfully work with other people, you have to trust each other. A big part of this is trusting people to get their work done wherever they are, without supervision.
