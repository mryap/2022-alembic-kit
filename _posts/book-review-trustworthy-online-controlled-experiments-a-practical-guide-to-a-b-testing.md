The web given it nature provides an unprecedented opportunity to evaluate ideas quickly using controlled experiments, also called randomized experiments - in marketing world known as A/B tests.

The book focus experiments in the online software domain (websites, mobile, desktop applications, and services). It highlight potential pitfalls in experiments and suggesting methods that improve trust in results.

Most who have run controlled experiments in customer-facing websites and applications have experienced this humbling reality: we are poor at assessing the value of ideas.

## Key Takeaway

* Use users as a randomization unit when running controlled experiments for online audiences. 
* It important to ensure the experimental design assigns an equal percentage of users to each variant, then each user should have an equal chance of being assigned to each variant.
* The fallacy of hastily drawing conclusion. For example, the introduction of feature X leads to a reduction in churn rate
* Online controlled experiments are best scientific way to establish causality with high probability
* OEC is the key metrics
* Always have a portfolio of ideas that includes a few radical ideas to see whether those jumps lead to a bigger hill.(pivot)
* To understand the value of an online experiment, look at the difference between its expected outcome and its actual result. 
* If you thought something minor was going to happen, and the results are a major surprise and lead to a breakthrough, youâ€™ve learned something highly valuable.

There are numerous books out there that are directly related to online experiments and A/B tests. Most are inspirational. Written by three co-authors who work at Google,LinkedIn,and Microsoft, the book provides in-depth and accuracy on the statistics behind online controlled experiment. 

On my first chapter of the book, I looking forward to reading it more.
