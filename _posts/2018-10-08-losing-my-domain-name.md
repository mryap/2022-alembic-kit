I used to have a personal site with domain name `getoptimise` dot com

My failure not to renew on times means someone bought it and I have to fork out
obsence amount to get it back. I always have the impression that domain name not
renew will be 'back to the pool' again and I can buy it back.

# All things consider

I want a domain name that catchy and reflect what I do -
Digital Analytics. A domain suggest work that involves numbers.  

I briefly check out other domain extension. Namely, `.CO`, `.ME` and `.IO`

There are lot of options open up when you go with `.CO`
I test my new domain name verbally with a family members not working in the internet industry
who are not active on Social Media. I learn that she automatically complete
`.CO` with `.UK` as in `.co.uk` or `.com` adding an M at the back of `.CO`

As my next domain name is also to be my trade
name, I do not want this to happen. People out of habit put `.com`, google it
and bring them to someone website.

I also consider pairing my family name with .ME but sounds so weird.

My search for the perfect domain name brings me to Twitter. The domain name also need to match a social media handle. At one point, I settle for a domain name and found out on Twitter, it is a hashtag for a
good fitted bra initiative!

# My lost is a gain in knowledge

While it not critical for me that the old domain name is lost. I want to get myself
familiar with the process so I can advise my client or future employer. If renewal time is up, don't put it off. Renew immediately when prompted by domain registrar timely reminder. There
are people who standby and snag them the moment when your domain name expired
when you did not renew on time.
